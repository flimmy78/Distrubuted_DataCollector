/*  The use of the following calls should be avoided if possible because 
    their use requires a very good understanding of the way this encryption 
    mode works and the way in which this code implements it in order to use 
    them correctly.

    The gcm_auth_data routine is used to authenticate encrypted message data.
    In message encryption gcm_crypt_data must be called before gcm_auth_data
    is called since it is encrypted data that is authenticated.  In message
    decryption authentication must occur before decryption and data can be
    authenticated without being decrypted if necessary.

    If these calls are used it is up to the user to ensure that these routines
    are called in the correct order and that the correct data is passed to 
    them.

    When gcm_compute_tag is called it is assumed that an error in use has
    occurred if both encryption (or decryption) and authentication have taken
    place but the total lengths of the message data respectively authenticated
    and encrypted are not the same. If authentication has taken place but 
    there has been no corresponding encryption or decryption operations (none
    at all) only a warning is issued. This should be treated as an error if it 
    occurs during encryption but it is only signalled as a warning as it might 
    be intentional when decryption operations are involved (this avoids having
    different compute tag functions for encryption and decryption). Decryption
    operations can be undertaken freely after authetication but if the tag is
    computed after such operations an error will be signalled if the lengths
    of the data authenticated and decrypted don't match.
